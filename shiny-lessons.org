#+TITLE: Empirical Notes on Shiny 


- It used to be better for Shinyscreen to retain the bare minimum of
  observers and keep as much of functionality as possible inside
  reactive functions. The fluidity of UI experience was reported to be
  better. Probably the logic of the application got better, too. But,
  going full reactive can sometimes be exhausting. These days, we
  build some stuff inside observers. All in moderation, though.

- Assignment to a reactive value does not add a dependency on that
  value.

- A reactive values list is not adding a dependency on all its
  members. Not even if it was nested inside some other reactive values
  list.

- An ordinary list inside reactive values list, if used, will add
  dependency on all its members. Even if only some of its members are
  used, the dependency is on all the members.
