** GUI Style Guide
*** Colour Scheme
    - LCSB colours?
*** Boxes
    - All boxes should have statuses. Shinydashboard defines
      ~primary~, ~success~, ~info~, ~warning~ and ~danger~.
    - Words in titles should be capitalised, except for /a/, /of/ et simile.
    - Titles for widgets, where applicable, should consists of full
      sentences. Yes, with a full-stop at the end.
*** Usage Flow
    The UI should feel sequential to the user, unless the actions that
    are being performed need continuous feedback, or
    refinement. Encapsulate things that rarely, or never change into
    steps that can be executed and then forgotten about.
